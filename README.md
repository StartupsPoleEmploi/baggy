# Installation

Copy the sample configuration:

    cp .env.sample .env

Edit the `.env` file and set appropriate values there. To generate random strings, such as the postal secret key or the various passwords, you can run:

    make randomstring

Then, run:

    make build
    make init
    make user
    make start

There should be a web UI accessible at http://localhost. To daemonize, run instead:

    make start-daemon

For more information, check out the [Postal documentation](https://github.com/atech/postal/wiki).

The `send.py` script can be run to test that the server is working properly.
