Copy the sample configuration:

    cp .env.sample .env

Edit the `.env` file and set appropriate values there.

Then, run:

    make build
    make initialize
    make user
    make start

There should be a web UI accessible at http://localhost. To daemonize, run instead:

    make start-daemon

The `send.py` script can be run to test that the server is working properly.
